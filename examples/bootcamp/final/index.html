		The gamemin.js file is simply a minified version of all the javascript files that the intro example requires to work. 
		The reason that this is also in its own 'final' folder is so that you can easily zip up this folder and upload it to the CocoonJS cloud compiler to test it out, if need be. But if you have modified any code then you will need to rebuild the 'gamemin.js' file with updated code.
