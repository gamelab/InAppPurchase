##Versions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.0 
- Initial released version of this plugin. 


##Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Made to help bring the inAppPurchase functionality that Cocoon offer's more easily accessable, and to use into Kiwi. This is so that when you are using Kiwi you can more easily execute the Cocoon code, add callbacks and access products/purchases made across the entire game without having to add in your own 'custom' management classes.

Whilst using this plugin it may be good to make use of the saveGame plugin, and the bitmap text plugin also. With the saveGame you can make use to localstorage to save any of your own 'currency' you may have. And the bitmaptext will allow you to more easily style any text you would like in-game.

If you have any problems then feel free to contact us via the [www.kiwijs.org](http://www.kiwijs.org/help) help form.

##Examples:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside the examples folder you can find three different examples of how you can use the inAppPurchase plugin. Each example functions in a different way to show varying methods of how you can implement IAP into your own game.

##Intro
This first example is a introductory examples of how you can have intergrate IAP into your game. It is the easiest of the examples codewise. In this example the productIDs are 'hard-coded' into the game, which means each time you want to add a new product to your shop, you would have to update the APP. No scrolling is added in this example.

##Sierra
The second example is slightly more complex than the first and demonstrates how you can get productID's (plus other information if you wanted to extend this example further) off a external server, which the example then uses to valid the products. This way you could easily add products without having to compile and update the app each time.

##BootCamp 
Bootcamp is a more robust example. In this example, we are using the platforms shop to buy 'virtual currency', which they can use to purchase weapons in the gam.e Like the sierra shop we are getting the products off a external server but in this example we are also sending throught the platform that we are requesting the productIDs for.


##How to Include: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

##First Step:
* Copy either the cocoonInAppPurchase.js or the cocoonInAppPurchase.min.js file (they should be right next to this one right now) into your project directory. We recommend that you save the files under a plugin directory that lives inside of your project directory so that you can easily manage all of the plugins but that is not required.

* Now copy across the CocoonJSExtensions folder also. You can either put the Extensions folder inside the plugins folder where we put the cocoonInAppPurchase or you can put it next to the plugin directory as the files inside of CocoonJSExtensions are not exclusive to this plugin.  


##Second Step:
* Firstly link in all of the javascript files inside of the CocoonJSExtensions folder in the following order. To be safe include these above Kiwi and your own game code :)

- CocoonJS.js
- CocoonJS_Ad.js
- CocoonJS_App.js
- CocoonJS_App_ForCocoonJS.js
- CocoonJS_Store.js

* Link in the JavaScript file (cocoonInAppPurchase.js or the min version of the file) into your HTML file. Make sure you link it in underneath the link to the main Kiwi.js file AND underneath all of the Cocoon files.


##Third: 
* Now that you have linked in the plugin, the next step is to tell the game to use this plugin. To do so, when you create a new Kiwi.Game you need to pass 'CocoonInAppPurchase' the confiration object's plugins item. You can see an example of the code below.

	var game = new Kiwi.Game('domElement', 'GameName', 'State', { plugins: ["CocoonInAppPurchase"]});

* Just make sure if you are including more than one System plugin that you pass other plugin's that you want to use also. (Like that SaveGame plugin you might be using).


##Lastly:
* Now that you have successfully include the plugin you can start using it. You can access the 'inAppPurchase' through the game object.


##Take Note!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This app will only work if you are making Cocoon apps and are targeting Cocoon when creating your games. Otherwise unexpected results will happen and the in app purchasing may not work. 

* You will still need to have some knowledge of the various markets with the different types of products and how they are handled/what they can do. We have tutorials on the Kiwi.JS website to help you with that. [www.kiwijs.org/documentation/tutorials/in-app-purchase-documentation](http://www.kiwijs.org/documentation/tutorials/in-app-purchase-documentation/) 

* All callbacks are Kiwi Signals, and so take this into account when you try to add callbacks to each property. 


##Purchase / Product Objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the plugin and its process two types of object are consistently used. Purchase and Product objects. The following documents the various indexs/namespaces located on them.

Purchase Object
* transactionId 
* purchaseTime
* purchaseState - (See below for documentation)
* productId
* quantity

	
Product Object
* productId
* productAtlas
* productType - (See below for documentation)
* title
* description
* price 
* localizedPrice - The localized price of the product if appropriate.
* downloadURL - The URL of any assets needing to be downloaded, can be blank.


##Product Types.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A brief list containing the different types of products. See market/platform documentation for more information. 	

* CONSUMABLE - 0
* NON-CONSUMABLE - 1 
* AUTO_RENEWABLE_SUBSCRIPTION - 2 
* FREE_SUBSCRIPTION - 3
* NON_RENEWABLE_SUBSCRIPTION - 4

Note: Each product object contains a "productType" index. That index is a number that relates to one of the following on the list above. You can detiremine what a type of product is through STATIC properties located on "Kiwi.Plugins.CocoonInAppPurchase.InAppPurchase.PRODUCT_TYPE"    


##Store Types.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When developing your app you may need to change certain implementations depending on the type of store. You can get the store being used through either the "storeType" property or the "getStore" method on the "inAppPurchase" object.

* APP_STORE - 0
* PLAY_STORE - 1
* MOCK_STORE - 2
* CHROME_STORE - 3
* AMAZON_STORE - 4
* NOOK_STORE - 5

You can access these STATIC versions of these numbers with the corresponding store type through "Kiwi.Plugins.CocoonInAppPurchase.InAppPurchase.STORE_TYPE"


##Purchase States
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a purchase is complete a 'purchaseState' will be on the 'purchase' object containing if the purchase was a success or not.

* PURCHASED - 0
* CANCELED - 1
* REFUNDED - 2
* EXPIRED - 3

You can access STATIC versions of these numbers with the corresponding numbers through "Kiwi.Plugins.CocoonInAppPurchase.InAppPurchase.PURCHASE_STATE"


##Testing Methods.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
While testing out your app you will want to make sure that if the user 'declines' at any part of the process your app will still work. These methods are there to help out with that. 

Note: The following methods are used only in the development/testing stages and will NOT work in a production enviroment.

	//Simulates the refunding of a purchase. 
	this.game.inAppPurchase.refundPurchase( transactionId );

	//Simulates the cancelation of a purchase.
	this.game.inAppPurchase.cancelPurchase( transactionId );

	//Simulates the expiration of a purchase
	this.game.inAppPurchase.expirePurchase( transactionId );
